# Netflix-Dataset-Analysis-and-Visualization-using-Python
📌 **Introduction**

This project analyzes the Netflix Titles dataset using Python for Data Analysis and Visualization (DAV). The dataset contains movies and TV shows available on Netflix along with details such as title, type, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and genre.

🎯 **Objectives**

-Clean and preprocess the dataset

-Explore content distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows)

-Analyze trends across release years

-Identify top contributing countries

-Examine audience ratings

-Visualize insights through plots and charts

🛠️ **Tools & Libraries**

-Python

-Pandas – Data manipulation

-Matplotlib – Data visualization

-Seaborn – Statistical plots

📊 **Data Overview**

-Total Records: 8,807

-Columns: 15

-Movies: 6,131 | TV Shows: 2,676

-Year Range: 1925 – 2021

-Top Countries: United States, India, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea
